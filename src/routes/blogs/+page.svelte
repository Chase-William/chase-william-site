      <p>
        During the Summer, Fall, and Spring of 2021 I was employed by the Center on Culture and
        Language <em>(CCL)</em> at RIT/NTID and integrated live captioning into the HoloLens 2. My
        team and I after several months of prep competed in one of RIT's largest technical
        showcases / competitions; the RIT Imagine event. My team and two others won the TAD
        <em>(technology, arts, and design)</em>.

      <p>
        After further development of the DotDocs project, the need of a library providing
        persistent storage has arrived. Therefore, and after much consideration, I will be using a
        graph database as the primary storage for assembly info. This update outlines my goals for
        the first iteration of implementation using Neo4j.

      <p>
        With much careful planning, I am proud to say I have implemented neo4j into DotDocs.
        Storage of <code>Repository</code>, <code>Project</code>, <code>Assembly</code>, and <code>Type</code> nodes with the appropriate relationships now exist. Checkout this blog to read more and see some screenshots of the results.

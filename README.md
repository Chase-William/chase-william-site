### Why I am developing my own site

Well, I have been learning and exploring the software world for around 4 years now. In this time I have grown not only my hard skills, but also my soft skills and I want to share my experiences/thoughts. This is where my site comes in, as it allows me to express my experiences/thoughts while also entertaining my technical/creative needs.

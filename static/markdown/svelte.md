## Exploring Svelte

You probably don't know this, but this website is being built with `Svelte` and various other techs. I have been down a long path of  user-interface frameworks, we're talking `Xamarin.Forms`, `Xamarin.Android`, native `iOS` app dev, `React` and now `Svelte` *(some frameworks have been omitted)*. So far I am in ❤️ with `Svelte` and especially `SvelteKit` as the **HMR** *(hot module replacement)* is to die for.
